                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        <p>
                          The broadest way to reach potential applicants is through online advertising. If the job description has been drawn up properly, there will be no problem in framing the advertisement to attract suitably qualified candidates. The following tips can be used to help employers get started:
                        </p>
                        <br/>
                        <ol>
                          <li><em>Set objectives:</em> You want to attract the attention of qualified candidates. Hold their interest so that your job description is thoroughly read. Arouse a desire for the opportunity offered and then stimulate them into action.</li>
                          <li><em>Informative content:</em> The advertisement should be thorough, providing the potential employee with answers to commonly asked questions.</li>
                          <li><em>Creating the job description:</em> Use a bold headline to capture attention. Stimulate interest by describing the job in the first paragraph in such a way that will make it personally rewarding. Create desire by mentioning opportunities for advancement early in the advertisement. Don't waste a lot of space describing the company; your potential candidate wants to know more about the job before they learn about the company history. Summarize the qualifications and experience, describe the compensation and then stimulate action by telling them how to apply.</li>
                          <li><em>Media selection:</em> Choose a media platform that has been successful in the past or that you know will fit a particular job vacancy. Don’t be shy; market directly to your target audience using modern digital resources such as LinkedIn, alumni boards, and professional associations.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        <p><strong class="author"><em>Great compensation:</em></strong> This is the primary concern of most candidates when evaluating a company to work for. The higher the pay is, the more likely employees are willing to devote their time and energy to help the company succeed.</p>
                        <br/>
                        <p><strong class="author"><em>The job:</em></strong> Employees are attracted to the satisfaction the job can give them. They can use and expand their skills in the job and look for opportunities for advancement.</p>
                        <br/>
                        <p><strong class="author"><em>Creative benefits and rewards:</em></strong> Many organizations offer great benefit packages to their employees. These benefits include bonuses, vacation, health, flex-time, telecommuting, etc.</p>
                        <br/>
                        <p><strong class="author"><em>Fun and safe working environment:</em></strong> Businesses realize that employees will work hard if the surroundings are fun. Music, games, breaks, and food are used to motivate them to work hard and they are given the freedom to complete given tasks with autonomy. They can also participate in decision making towards everyday policies and procedures. This shows that their views are respected.</p>
                        <br/>
                        <p><strong class="author"><em>Cooperative and helpful colleagues:</em></strong> The existing employees contribute to the overall company culture, therefore, making an impression on the new employee from the start. New employees count on their new colleagues to assist them with any difficulties or problems that arise in their new environment.</p>
                        <br/>
                        <p><strong class="author"><em>The organization’s reputation:</em></strong> Many employees find companies that have good reputations easy to work for. Businesses like these show that they are long established and know every trick of the trade and the industry. An excellent corporate culture also attracts employees because they have good practices that make them successful.</p>
                        <br/>
                        <p><strong class="author"><em>Leadership:</em></strong> Managers learn employees’ names and treat them as individuals. They recognize employees’ goals and needs and provide recognition and praise to employees consistently. Strong leadership within an organization attracts high quality candidates.</p>
                        <br/>
                        <p>As you prepare to onboard your next employee, or run your next campaign to fill a position within your company, consider these points in measuring your success. It will help you attract qualified candidates with the potential for longevity and positive impact on your organization.</p>

                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        <p>In a recent poll the question was asked “If you were looking for a new job today what is the most important aspect?”  Not surprising, the answers were relatively close in rankings.</p>
                        <br/>
                        <ul>
                          <li>45% said pay and benefits</li>

                          <li>25% company culture</li>
                          <li>4% workload</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br/>
                        <p>Compensation has consistently been in first place on employee satisfaction surveys (SHRM, 2007). However, as important as that factor is, it clearly is not the only component employees consider when choosing a company to work with.</p>

                        <p>Employers today are starting to recognize that an organization's staff is its most critical assets. Employees are investments that will provide long-term rewards to the organization through greater productivity if effectively managed and developed. Employees with the right qualifications and experiences in the business can contribute in helping the leadership team operate the organization effectively and efficiently.</p>

                        <p>
                          <strong class="author"><em>Pay:</em></strong> First, make sure that the salary package is attractive or competitive at best. This means paying the market rate unless the job or the company's reputation is good enough to persuade people to settle for less. Just remember, you get what you pay for. You can find out what the market rates are by using job sites like Salary.com, Glassdoor and Indeed. There is no value in offering less that the average. How far you go above the average depends on how badly you want to attract the best available candidates and the extent to which you need to compensate for any drawbacks in the job.

                        <br/>
                        <p>
                          <strong class="author"><em>Benefits:</em></strong> Many companies are offering non-traditional benefits to help employee's balance the details of their professional and personal lives.  Benefits such as life insurance, medical coverage, paid leaves, short- and long-term disability and 401(k) plans have become standard. Competitive compensation packages need to increasingly focus on the specialized needs of workers, i.e. flex-time, educational assistance, telecommuting and daycare options.
                        </p>
                        <br/>
                        <p>
                          <strong class="author"><em>The job:</em></strong> Keeping your descriptions relevant and up-to-date in the advertisement or at the interview is imperative. Misrepresenting a job usually causes more harm than good and will affect your employee retention in the long run.  Review the job requirements frequently and update them as needed. Keeping the parties interested and challenged with the opportunity for potential growth are key to attracting the right candidates for the job.

                    <p class="pull-right by-who">By: <strong class="author">Fred Wilson</strong></p>
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <div class="row">

                        <p>The news out of Uber last weekend was horrifying. A woman engineer was unable to get human resources to deal quickly and appropriately with a sexual harassment claim. I don’t know anything more than what I learned in her blog post. Uber is investigating and the full story will likely emerge in due course. I am not interested in piling on Uber right now. Plenty of people doing that.</p>
                        <p>But it does raise a great question which is how to get human resources right in a fast-growing tech company. Growing from 50 to 500 to 5,000 to tens of thousands of employees is hard. Operating systems and processes that work in a 500-person company don’t work in a 5,000 company. The same is true of every growth spurt. Systems break down and stuff gets messed up.</p>

                    </div>
                    <div class="row">
                      <div class="col-xs-12">
                        <p>A well designed and implemented human resources organization can help. A messed up human resources organization will hurt. As Uber has found out.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>So what have I seen work and what do I recommend?</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Here are some things you can do to increase the chances that your human resources organization will be a force for good in your company:</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>1.	Hire a human resources (HR) leader EARLY in the development of your company and “level up” your HR leader as needed as your company grows. The right HR leader in a company of 50 is not likely the right HR in a company of 5,000. Of course, there are exceptions to this rule, but in general you will need more experience in the HR leadership function as your company grows.</p>
                        <p>2.	Have your HR leader report directly to the CEO. Do not tuck the HR leader underneath your COO, VP Ops, CFO, GC, or VP Admin. The CEO has a hard-enough time figuring out what is going on in her company as it is. Putting someone between them and their cultural leader/thermostat is a bad idea. Plus the optics are terrible. Your management hierarchy says a lot about what you value and what you do not. Actions speak louder than words, always.</p>
                        <p>3.	Do not make your HR function a recruiting function. Of course, HR needs to help the company hire. And it certainly needs to help transition out people who have to leave the organization. But HR orgs that function mostly as an I/O pipe are bad HR orgs.</p>
                        <p>4. Do make your HR organization about culture and leadership first and foremost. I have heard many HR leaders called “our culture carrier.” That’s good. And HR orgs should be making sure everyone is getting feedback on their performance and development goals, including the CEO. Organizations that share feedback top to bottom with dignity and professionalism are great places to work and perform better.</p>
                        <p>5. Always have a company handbook that lays out the rules of behavior in the workforce. You can’t do this too early. You set the tone early and it propagates. It is great if you can start with your values, clearly laid out for everyone, and then lay out the rules and what happens if they are not followed.</p>
                        <p>6.	Build a great employee onboarding process. I believe that the companies that take the time to properly onboard new employees are better places to work and perform better. Onboarding should be more than “here’s your laptop, here’s your desk, here’s your boss.” It should be at least a few weeks of getting ingrained in the values, culture, systems, processes, and rules. It should be learning about every part of the organization, the current operating plan, strategic priorities, management team, and more. Doing it right is hard but it pays off bigtime.</p>
                        <p>7. One CEO that I have worked with for more than fifteen years once told me his HR leader was his most important senior executive. He said she was his “business partner.” That’s a great place to get to if you can get there. What is more important than your team, after all?</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>I hope those suggestions are helpful. They are based on what I’ve seen work and not work over the years.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>In the Uber situation we also saw a failure in the “whistleblower process.” This is a particularly hard process to get right. First of all most teams, whatever kind of team, don’t really want “snitches.” It is human nature to try to come together and support each other. And blowing the whistle is the exact opposite of that. So here are some things you can do to get this right:</p>
                        <br>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Train your organization about the situations that are particularly tricky; sexual harassment, drug and alcohol issues, fraud, etc. Teach everyone how to recognize them and what to do about them. Make it clear that they are EXPECTED to report these issues to management and that failure to do so is complicit behavior.</li>
                          <li>Have some sort of whistleblower hotline. Often times the company General Counsel will manage this hotline. Make sure everyone knows about it.</li>
                          <li>Enable anonymous feedback throughout the organization and explain when it is appropriate and when it is not. Obviously anonymous feedback has great potential for abuse. But it is often the only way you are going to get the most important feedback that nobody will share otherwise.</li>
                          <li>Talk about this stuff in your all hands, regularly. I am sure this is a big topic this week but it should not get talked about only when something bad happens somewhere. This is something that should be discussed at least a couple times a year. Companies that scale rapidly can double in size in less than a year. So you have to talk about this stuff frequently to make sure everyone understands it. And make sure to clearly cover it in the onboarding process.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        <p>If you don’t have this stuff worked out in your company, now is a great time to do that. Your employees are watching you.</p>

                      <p>For the first time in history there are five generations in the workforce at the same time. This means there are differences in values and work ethics. So, with multiple generations in the workforce how do you inspire and motivate your employees? </p>
                      <p>First, you need to acknowledge that one size does not fit all. What motivates the veterans or traditionalists and the baby boomers does not inspire or motivate the millennials. Generation Y or Z workers in the workplace.</p>

                        <p>Motivation is key to individual performance, group productivity, and maintaining a winning culture. Inspiration is a lost art and comes in small doses and is usually doled out in the form of praise and/or promotion. </p>
                        <p>Employees, regardless of generational placement, are more motivated when they feel needed, appreciated, and valued by their company and their peers.</p>

                        <strong class="author">Tips for engaging your multigenerational workforce:</strong>
                        <ul>
                          <li>1.	Create project/function oriented assignments allowing for cross-generational input. </li>
                          <li>2.	Communicate effectively and often using different mediums. </li>
                          <li>3.	Listen to your audience </li>
                          <li>4.	Keep an open mind when they bring issues to the table</li>
                          <li>5.	Look beyond appearances</li>
                          <li>6.	Consider individual needs</li>
                          <li>7.	Emphasize commonalities and strengths</li>
                          <li>8.	Acknowledge work/life expectations</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br/>
                        <p>Lastly, encourage everyone to be their best selves. Take a genuine interest in them as individuals. Talk to them about their hopes, dreams and interests. Encourage them to change jobs or seek other opportunities within the organization that are better suited to their passion and skill set. </p>
                        <p>Each generation reacts differently to motivational techniques and inspiration. The bottom line is everyone wants to be treated fairly, have their needs met and feel as though their work is making a difference no matter what that might look like in the end. </p>
                        <p>I understand that inspiring and motivating people can be difficult and tricky but it is not impossible. Having to keep 10 children that span 3 generations inspired and motivated to get up for school every morning has been nothing short of miraculous. What worked for the boys definitely did not work for the girls and vice versa. My older children were motivated to keep Mom happy and amenable to their requests for privileges when asked whereas the younger kids are not motivated to keep Mom happy; they are more interested in keeping themselves happy.  One tactic to inspire my oldest daughter to excel and work extra hard at something does not phase my youngest daughter. Each has their own set of values and needs they want met and are willing to do different things to achieve the same outcome. I marvel at the ingenuity of these children and the nuances of each but am proud of how they are exceling in life and school and are motivated and inspiring individuals.</p>

                        <p>A champion is a person who voluntarily takes extraordinary interest in the adoption, implementation, and success of a cause, policy, program, project, or product. To have done so successfully is said to champion change. They will typically try to force the idea through deep-rooted internal resistance to change, and will evangelize it throughout the organization. This has been known to work but it has also been known to backfire.</p>
                        <p>Smart leaders are said to champion change. How? By selling their ideas; i.e., they look for ways to get people emotionally committed to the change. And, they are sure to have an edge or stake in the change. They tell stories, paint a vision of a better future, and engage positive emotions. They stay focused on the benefits rather than the costs and understand people need time to adjust to and to accept the change. They work to inspire buy-in instead of compliance.</p>

                        <p>Successful leaders understand that people in their organization do the work, change behaviors, and, ultimately, make the change happen. Championing them on will increase the chances of the change taking place and working for the good of the people and the organization.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Aubrey Daniels, noted behavioral analyst and author of Bringing Out the Best in People, makes two great comments regarding the process of change acceptance:</p>
                        <p>“People don’t resist change, they resist being changed,” and “People don’t resist change if the change provides immediate positive consequences to them.”</p>
                        <p>Smart leaders know that people are generally more willing to do things that bring personal benefit than they are to do things which benefit the organization. Over the course of time, successful leaders have learned people need both information about the reason behind the change and time to adjust to it. They also realize they can’t wait endlessly to get everyone to commit to the change. By breaking big changes into small pieces, people are more likely to accept the change more quickly. Breaking change into small pieces, helps leaders move their organizations with frequent, continual, and steady forward progress rather than through periodic big jumps. This helps build momentum and keep it moving.</p>
                        <p>I saw this work first hand in my life as I transitioned from a stay at home mom to a working mom. Having to get 10 children to adjust to me leaving the house for hours at a time was not something I was willing to thrust upon them all at once. I broke it down into bite size chunks they could get used to and successfully navigated myself back into the corporate world. This was accomplished by taking part-time work for 2-4 hours a day during which time I scheduled play dates for the kids. While they felt they were the beneficiaries of mommy being out of the house consistently while they had play dates, I was able to establish a routine in which we could both benefit from.</p>
                        <p>I negotiated with the older children routines for the younger kids by offering them a “what’s in it for me scenario”. They wanted freedom to drive, hang out with friends and be independent. They earned these privileges by assisting me with carpooling activities, giving baths and entertaining their siblings while I worked, cooked dinner and got everyone settled for the night. We worked in shifts and it all balanced itself out. Nothing like offering the car to a seventeen-year-old if they stopped by the store and got a loaf of bread and a gallon on milk on their way home. Eventually it got to the point where I didn’t have to ask them to do anything in exchange for the car or their independence; they offered it up for free.</p>
